# I completed the course
Today I completed the Spring framework course by Code Academy officially acquiring my first certification in Java for completing the course and building my own Spring application. Despite it taking a while I have been using Spring for quite a while and preparing to use it for my next major project for 333Cloud. I am so excited to gain new skills and learn so much more about building, deploying, and securing web services.
